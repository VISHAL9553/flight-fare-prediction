PRCP-1025-FlightPricePrediction

Problem Statement - 
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check
out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often
heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. That’s why we will
try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting
what prices they can maintain.

## Appendix

Any additional information goes here

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight
prices and plan their journey accordingly.

Dataset Link:

We have to analyze the flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset using
essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about
the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is
the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source,
destination and more.

## Attribute Information
1. Airline: So this column will have all the types of airlines like Indigo, Jet Airways,
Air India, and many more.

2. Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the
passenger’s journey will start.

3. Source: This column holds the name of the place from where the passenger’s
journey will start.

4. Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers
wanted to travel.

5. Route: Here we can know about what the route is through which passengers
have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.

6. Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.


7. Duration: Duration is the whole period that a flight will take to complete its
journey from source to destination.

8. Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for
the flight in the whole journey.

9. Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food,
and other amenities.

10. Price: Price of the flight for a complete journey including all the expenses
before onboarding.

## ALGORITHM USED

1) Linear Regression - In statistics, linear regression is a statistical model which estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

2) Lasso Regression - also known as L1 regularization—is a form of regularization for linear regression models. Regularization is a statistical method to reduce errors caused by overfitting on training data. This approach can be reflected with this formula: w-hat = argminw MSE(W ) + ||w||1

3) Ridge regression - Ridge regression is a statistical regularization technique. It corrects for overfitting on training data in machine learning models. Ridge regression—also known as L2 regularization—is one of several types of regularization for linear regression models.

4) Random forest - Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm, trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, that combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.

5) Decision Tree - A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

6) AdaBoost - Adaboost is an ensemble learning technique used to improve the predictive accuracy of any given model by combining multiple “weak” learners. Adaboost works by weighting incorrectly classified instances more heavily so that the subsequent weak learners focus more on the difficult cases.

7) GradientBoosting - Gradient Boosting is a popular boosting algorithm in machine learning used for classification and regression tasks. Boosting is one kind of ensemble Learning method which trains the model sequentially and each new model tries to correct the previous model. It combines several weak learners into strong learners.
